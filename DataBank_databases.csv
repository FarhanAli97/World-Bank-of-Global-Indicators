The construction of the wealth accounts is guided by the concepts and methods of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the handbook developed by the UN Statistical Commission used by virtually all countries to compile their national economic accounts. While values for produced capital and net foreign assets are generally derived from widely used methods based on observed transactions for these assets, the value of natural capital and human capital must be estimated. The approach to asset valuation is based on the concept that the value of an asset should equal the discounted stream of expected net earnings (resource rents or wages) that it earns over its lifetime.  ,  , Last Updated:10/08/2024"
54,Economic Fitness,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/economic-fitness/preview/on,"Economic FitnessPublic  Economic Fitness (EF) is both a measure of a country’s diversification and ability to produce complex goods on a globally competitive basis.  Countries with the highest levels of EF have capabilities to produce a diverse portfolio of products, ability to upgrade into ever-increasing complex goods, tend to have more predictable long-term growth, and to attain good competitive position relative to other countries.   Countries with low EF levels tend to suffer from poverty, low capabilities, less predictable growth, low value-addition, and trouble upgrading and diversifying faster than other countries. The comparison of the Fitness to the GDP reveals hidden information for the development and the growth of the countries.  ,  , Last Updated:04/19/2018"

These include indicators measuring the ratio between diet costs and international food poverty lines and indicators measuring the share and volume of the population unable to afford each diet, based on income distributions observed in each country.
